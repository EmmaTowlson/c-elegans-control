
Notes:

1. Celegans_MuscleControllability_LowerBound: 
   Assess the lower bound of the number of controllable muscles for the healthy worm, i.e. when there are no neuron ablations.

2. Celegans_MuscleControllability_UpperBound_and_SingleGroup_Ablations:
   Assess the upper bound of the number of controllable muscles for the healthy worm, and also assess the effect of each group ablation (note that it can be easily revised to assess the effect of each individual neuron ablation). The main predictions come from this code.
