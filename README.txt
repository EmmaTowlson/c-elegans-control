
Notes:

1. Celegans_MuscleControllability_LowerBound: 
   Assess the lower bound of the number of controllable muscles for the healthy worm, i.e. when there are no neuron ablations.

2. Celegans_MuscleControllability_UpperBound_and_SingleGroup_Ablations:
   Assess the upper bound of the number of controllable muscles for the healthy worm, and also assess the effect of each group ablation. The main predictions from Yan, VÃ©rtes, Towlson, et al come from this code. Note that it can be easily revised to assess the effect of each individual, pair, or triple neuronal ablation (or indeed any desired selection of neuronal ablations).
